# Beginner Tutorials

Here is the sample curriculum that Coding Cadet uses to teach its beginner course. Each week includes HTML and CSS files with the description and application of all of the concepts learned during the lesson. The beginner curriculum teaches beginner HTML and CSS concepts alongside modern practices such as responsive design with Twitter's Bootstrap and icons with Font Awesome. The lessons teach in order:
* Week 1: Head and Body, Paragraphs, Headings, Images
* Week 2: Introduction to CSS
* Week 3: Youtube videos, Lists, Ids and Classes
* Week 4: Tables, non-breaking spaces, line break, horizontal line

* Week 6: Navbars and Bootstrap Grid System
* Week 7: Styling Navbar, Font Awesome, User Experience

At the top of each lesson, there is a Google Drive link to the presentation used during each lesson. The Review and Prompt powerpoint at the top of Week 7 gives a basic review of the previous lessons and a prompt for a sample website. The beginner Coding Cadets are given 3 weeks to complete websites based on this prompt. Check their awesome work out at http://www.codingcadet.com/portfolio!
